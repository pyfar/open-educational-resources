Open Educational Resources
==========================

Welcome to the pyfar open educational resources on acoustics, a collection of Jupyter notebooks with coding assignments. If you are a student, you can check out and download the notebooks directly below. They contain various acoustics assignments without solutions. If you are a teacher who wants to access solution notebooks or contribute an assignment, please refer to the `contributing guidelines <https://pyfar-gallery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute/index.html>`_.

.. note::

   We are in the process of creating the resources for courses in winter 25/26. More assignments are coming soon.
