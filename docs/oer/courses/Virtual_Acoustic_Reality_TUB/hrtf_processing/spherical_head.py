    r"""
    Generate spherical head transfer functions (SHTFs).

    Generates free field SHTFs following [#]_ and returns them as a
    :py:class:`pyfar.Signal` object. Following the HRTF definition [#]_,
    the SHTFs are defined as the ratio

    :math:`\mathrm{SHTF}(\mathbf{x}_\text{ear}, \mathbf{x}_\text{source})=\frac{P_\text{sphere}(\mathbf{x}_\text{ear}, \mathbf{x}_\text{source})}{P_\text{ref}(\mathbf{x}_\text{ref})}`

    with :math:`P_\text{sphere}` being the complex sound pressure on the
    surface of the sphere, :math:`P_\text{ref}` the reference sound pressure at
    the origin of coordinates, and :math:`\mathbf{x}` the positions of the ear
    (on the surface of a sphere), the free field point source, and the point
    source used for referencing. Often
    :math:`\mathbf{x}_\text{source}=\mathbf{x}_\text{ref}` is used. The
    spherical head views in positive x direction, the left ear has a positive y
    coordinate, and the right ear a negative y coordinate.

    .. note ::

        The SHTFs are shifted in time to assure that the earliest possible peak
        in the impulse responses occurs at approximately 20 samples for the
        case of a contralateral source position. This works well if
        :math:`\mathbf{x}_\text{source}=\mathbf{x}_\text{ref}`. Other cases
        might require an additional shift to force causality.

    .. note ::

        Because the 0 Hz value can not be computed, a low frequency with a
        wavelength equal to a hundred times the spherical head diameter is
        used. This yields 19.6 Hz for the default values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coordinates : pyfar.Coordinates
        The coordinates of the point sources :math:`\mathbf{x}_\text{source}`
        for which the SHTFs are computed. Must have a `cdim` (channel
        dimension) of 1.
    head : sparhpy.SamplingSphere
        The positions of the left ear defined by the first point and the
        position of the right ear defined by the second point. Must be
        of cshape of ``(2, )``. Both points must have the same radius, which
        defines the radius of the spherical head. The default uses ear
        positions at azimuth angles of :math:`\pm90^\circ` on the equator of
        the spherical head and a radius of ``0.0875`` meter.
    head_position : str, pyfar.Coordinates, optional
        Defines the position of the head center with respect to the global
        coordinate system in which `coordinates` are given.

        ``'origin'``
            The head center is at the origin of coordinates.
        ``'interaural center'``
            The center of the head is moved to make sure that the interaural
            center, that is, the mid point between the two ears, is at the
            origin of coordinates.
        coordinate
            A pyfar Coordinates object with a single point that defines the
            center of the head.

        The default is ``'origin'``
    reference_distance : str, float, array like, optional
        Defines the distance of the reference point source from the origin
        of coordinates.

        ``'coordinates'``
            Takes the distance from `coordinates` (see above).
        float or array like
            The reference distance in meter.

        The default is ``'coordinates'``.
    n_max : int, optional
        The spherical harmonic order up to which the SHTF is approximated.
         The default is ``100``.
    n_samples : int, optional
        The length of the spherical head impulse responses in samples.
        The default is ``1024``
    sampling_rate : float, optional
        The sampling rate in Hz. The default is 44100.
    speed_of_sound : int, optional
        The speed of sound in meter per second. The default is ``343``.

    Returns
    -------
    shtf : pyfar.Signal
        The spherical head transfer function as a pyfar Signal of cshape
        (M, 2), where M is the number of points given in `coordinates`.
        ``shtf[:, 0]`` contains the left ear data and ``shtf[:, 1]`` the right
        ear data.

    r"""
    Compute complex valued sound pressure on the surface of a sphere.

    The pressure emitted by a free field point source at a point on a rigid
    sphere :math:`p_\text{s}` is computed according to the iterative
    formulation given by Duda & Martens [#]_. It is referenced to the pressure
    of a point source :math:`p_\text{s}` observed at the center of the sphere
    with the sphere being absent

    :math:`H = \frac{p_\text{s}}{p_\text{ff}}\,.`

    This implementation is an extended version, that allows different distances
    for :math:`p_\text{s}` and :math:`p_\text{ff}`.

    .. note ::

        The parameters `theta`, `distance`, or `reference_distance` can be
        array likes but must be broadcastable to a common shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sphere_radius : float
        The radius of the sphere in meter.
    theta : float, array like
        Angle (great circle distance) in radians between the point source
        :math:`p_\text{s}` and the point on the sphere at which the pressure is
        computed.
    distance : float, array like
        Distance of the point source :math:`p_\text{s}` to the center of the
        sphere in meter.
    reference_distance : float, array like
        Distance of the referencing point source :math:`p_\text{ff}` to the
        center of the sphere in meter. Often the same as `distance`.
    frequencies : float, array like
        The frequencies in Hz, for which the sound pressure is computed. Must
        be greater than 0.
    speed_of_sound : float
        The speed of sound in meters per second.
    n_max : int
        The spherical harmonic oder up to which the sound pressure is computed.

    Returns
    -------
    pressure : pyfar.FrequencyData
        The sound pressure on the sphere.
