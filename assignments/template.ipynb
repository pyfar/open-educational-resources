This assumes that the background and math was introduced by the lecturer before starting the assignment. Also give at least one reference which provides a more comprehensive background of the assignment. A lecturer should be able to understand the assignment after going through the references. Please provide a minimum set of references just enough to achieve this. The dependencies should list all packages that must be installed to run the notebook. If specific versions of packages are required, this should be noted as in the example below.\n",
